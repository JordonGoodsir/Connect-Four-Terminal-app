#### Status Update 1 

##### Problem: Selector function

##### Date: April 23rd 2020  

I am having difficulty making the selector function work. The intended outcome is for the player piece to move in the array at the top of the board, as they click the controls to move it along. However I am having difficulties binding keys with the gem 'io/console' and swapping items in the array. To proceed I intend to do more research on  io/console and further review documentation on array functionality. If this issue persists I will seek the help from educators to guide me in the right direction.



#### Status Update 2  

##### Problem: Piece placing

##### Date: April 24rd 2020 

I am having difficulty making the piece placing function properly.  The intended outcome is for pieces to be placed at the bottom the the column based off the users input from the selector function. However I am unsure on how to assign each column a unique value while keeping my code DRY. To proceed I intend to experiment with various different ruby expressions and read up on documentation regarding them. If this issue persists I will seek the help from educators to guide me in the right direction.
