# ReadMe, Connect Four edition



### Statement of Purpose and Scope 



##### What the app does

Connect Four introduces the two characters with the main menu, for which they are able to create their player names. Once finished they are greeted with the vertical seven by six board and players are assigned a marker "x" and "o" respectively. Players take turns to put their pieces at the bottom of the board to attempt to connect 4 of their pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four, this resulting in a win. The victorious player will have their name displayed and dubbed victorious. 

##### Problem it will solve 

Connect Four will attempt to solve boredom and possibly act as an icebreaker. Solving boredom through its intellectually challenging and entertaining nature, as both players must analyse the others move so as to not allow them to win. Acting as an icebreaker as organisations (e.g.. schools) could use with app as a way to introduce new people through Connect Fours co-op nature. 

##### Target Audience 

Connect Four is skewed towards a younger audience who wish to play a game with their friend to kill time.  This being especially relevant in todays circumstances, with video gaming being an increasingly poplar hobby amongst youths. With this digitised copy of Connect Four it attempts to appeal to that audience bringing back the once physical game enjoyed by many in digital form.

##### How will target audience use this app? 

The younger target audience will play Connect Four with a friend, choosing each move carefully timulating their mind while simultaneously having fun and socialising.
